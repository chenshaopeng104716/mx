MX is a library of essential cheminformatics models and routines. It was created
with the goal of providing a clean, well-tested platform for chemistry
applications.

Features:

- Substructure search and atom mapping based on the VF algorithm
- Exhaustive ring perception based on the Hanser algorithm
- Flexible query atom support
- Flexible generation of path-based binary fingerprints
- Depth-First traversal
- Implicit hydrogen detection
- Complete system of atomic masses and isotopes based on the IUPAC Technical
  Report.
- Model objects (Molecule, Atom, Bond, Superatom) based on MDL CTfile
  specification
- Molfile/SDFile reader and writer

Language:

MX is written in Java and has been used with Scala in addition to Ruby and Python
through the JRuby and Jython interpreters.

Dependencies:

-  JDK 1.5 or higher
-  Ant (to compile and run tests)

License:

MX is distributed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.
